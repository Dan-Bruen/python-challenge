Python Homework Challenge for Dan Bruen

## Objectives

### PyBank

In this challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of my company. I am given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, my company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### PyPoll

In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)


I have been given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

In addition, my final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
